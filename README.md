# Researcher Desktop App
## A notes and annotation manager built on top of [Zotero](http://zotero.com/)
### Uses
Zotero is a fantastic resource for keeping track of source metadata and citations. But when it comes to note-taking, it's lacking. Researcher takes the sources in your Zotero library, extracts any annotations from associated PDFs and displays them in an easy-to-use interface. For a given project, keep all you notes in an accessible place that updates alongside your research.
